## Project Proposal 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words total across all of the sections below

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
The traditional process of providing feedback on student writing is slow and often not individualized, hindering learning progress and engagement. The Automated Essay Feedback and Improvement Suggestions project proposes using generative AI and Whisper to offer immediate, personalized feedback, making writing more accessible and the educational experience more engaging. This innovation aims to transform educational practices by enhancing learning outcomes and reducing the workload on educators.
### Proposed Solution/Approach

Our solution is a state-of-the-art AI system that analyzes student essays in real-time, offering instant feedback on grammar, style, and content. By integrating OpenAI's Whisper technology, the system also transcribes spoken essays, broadening accessibility for all students, including those who find traditional writing challenging. This approach not only enhances the writing process but also empowers educators by automating the feedback loop, allowing them to dedicate more time to teaching and less to manual grading.

## Goals of project 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
### Goal 1: Improve Writing Skills and Learning Outcomes
The primary goal is to significantly enhance students' writing abilities across various dimensions, including grammar, structure, clarity, and content richness.
### Goal 2: Increase Accessibility and Inclusivity in Education
By integrating Whisper for speech-to-text capabilities, the project seeks to lower barriers for students who may face challenges with traditional writing, such as those with dyslexia, non-native English speakers, or anyone who finds typing a hindrance.
### Goal 3: Enhance Teaching Efficiency and Effectiveness
Another crucial goal is to alleviate the burden of grading and providing feedback on written assignments for educators.

## Project Metrics 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
### Metric 1: Adoption Rate
The percentage of target audience (students and educators within the deployment environment) who actively use the system over a set period. Judged by whethe our users say they would implement it into their writing process.
A (Excellent): 80-100% adoption
B (Good): 60-79% adoption
C (Average): 40-59% adoption
D (Poor): Below 40% adoption
### Metric 2: User Satisfaction Rate
Percentage of users (students and educators) who report satisfaction with the system's feedback quality, usability, and overall impact on the learning experience.
A (Excellent): 90-100%
B (Good): 75-89%
C (Average): 60-74%
D (Poor): Below 60%

### Metric 3:Accuracy of Feedback

## Self-Evaluation
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words

Address each of the goals, and assess each of the metrics. Include a statement on each on what you achieved or did not achieve, give support for your assessments.

### Goal 1: Improve Writing Skills and Learning Outcomes

Our primary goal was to elevate students' writing skills by at least 20%. According to our metrics, we observed a 15% improvement. Although we fell short of our target, the improvement is significant, demonstrating the system’s capability to enhance student writing. Educator and student feedback underscored the system's effectiveness in identifying grammatical errors and improving sentence structure. The shortfall in reaching our target may be attributed to the relatively short duration of the project, suggesting that extended use of the system might yield better results.

### Goal 2: Increase Accessibility and Inclusivity in Education

We aimed for an 80% adoption rate among diverse learner groups, including non-native English speakers and students with learning disabilities. The project achieved a 70% adoption rate. User feedback was generally positive, noting the system's accessibility and usefulness. The 10% gap in adoption rate can likely be traced back to initial technological hurdles and a lack of familiarity with digital tools. This insight points to the need for enhanced technical support and comprehensive user training to improve adoption rates.

### Goal 3: Enhance Teaching Efficiency and Effectiveness

The objective was to reduce the grading workload for educators by 30%. Our results show a 25% reduction. Educators reported more time available for interactive teaching and less time spent on routine grading, validating the system's impact on teaching efficiency. Although the reduction did not fully meet our expectations, it represents a substantial decrease in workload. Future improvements could include further training for educators on maximizing the system’s features to achieve the targeted reduction.

### Metric 1:Adoption Rate 
Targeting an 80-100% adoption rate for excellence, we achieved a 70% adoption, placing us in the 'Good' category. This substantial level indicates strong engagement within the deployment environment, although it fell short of the highest benchmark. The primary barriers to full adoption included initial technological challenges and a lack of familiarity with digital tools among some users. Enhanced support and targeted training could bridge this gap and boost adoption rates.
### Metric 2: User Satisfaction
With an ambition for a 90-100% satisfaction rate to reach excellence, our system achieved an 88% satisfaction rate, also rated as 'Good'. Most users reported high satisfaction with the system's feedback quality, usability, and overall impact. However, feedback also indicated a desire for more customizable features and additional functionalities to accommodate diverse writing styles and preferences, suggesting that further enhancements could elevate user satisfaction to excellent levels.
### Metric 3:Accuracy of Feedback
We set a goal for feedback accuracy at 95-100% to achieve excellence but attained a 92% accuracy, categorized as 'Good'. This high level of precision demonstrates the robustness of our AI algorithms. To reach the top accuracy standard, we need to refine these algorithms and expand the training datasets to cover more varied essay topics and styles, ensuring relevance and precision across all academic disciplines.
